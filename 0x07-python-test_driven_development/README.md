0x07. Python - Test-driven Development

Description

This project focuses on the principles and practice of Test-Driven Development (TDD) in Python. By the end of this project, you will have a solid understanding of how to write and test Python code effectively, covering interactive and non-interactive tests, documentation, and edge-case handling.

Learning Objectives

Understand the importance of writing tests before code.

Learn to write and execute Python test cases.

Use doctest and unittest modules for testing.

Identify and handle edge cases in Python programs.

Write comprehensive documentation for modules and functions.

Requirements

Python Scripts

All files are written in Python 3.8.5.

Must end with a new line.

Start with the shebang #!/usr/bin/python3.

Adheres to PEP8 style guidelines (verified using pycodestyle v2.8.*).

Executable permissions set for all scripts.

Test Files

Located in the tests/ folder.

Files have a .txt extension.

Tests executed using python3 -m doctest ./tests/*.

Each module and function includes documentation.
