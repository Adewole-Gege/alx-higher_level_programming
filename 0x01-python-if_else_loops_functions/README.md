Tasks
0. Positive or Negative
Complete the code to print whether the variable number holds a positive or negative value.

1. Last Digit
Modify the code to display the last digit of the number stored in number.

2. Alphabet Game
Write a program that outputs the lowercase ASCII alphabet without a newline at the end.
